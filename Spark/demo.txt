If you come slightly before 10am, please enter the room and stand near the stage -
that way, I can briefly introduce you to students and then we all go out and mingle:
there will be some breakfast items outside the room, and the plan is to go see the solar
eclipse together on the lawn (the Physics department said they'd have special viewing glasses etc.).
All you need to do is mingle with new students, be friendly, answer their questions :-)
