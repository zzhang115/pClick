Recently, Google developed a method called Word2Vec that captures the context of words, while at the same time reducing the size of the data. Word2Vec is actually two different methods: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram. In the CBOW method, the goal is to predict a word given the surrounding words. Skip-gram is the converse: we want to predict a window of words given a single word (see Figure 1). Both methods use artificial neural networks as their classification algorithm. Initially, each word in the vocabulary is a random N-dimensional vector. During training, the algorithm learns the optimal vector for each word using the CBOW or Skip-gram method.
